Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊 <a name="eda"></a>
The EDA notebook explores customer data, examining relationships between ClientNum ranges and customer behavior.
It visualizes attrition patterns, feature correlations, and provides initial hypotheses on why customers might churn.
Model Training and Evaluation 🏋️ <a name="model-training"></a>
RandomForest & XGBoost Models: Two classification models are trained using various oversampling techniques to handle class imbalance.
Evaluation Metrics: Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall scores are calculated to measure model accuracy, recall, and F1-scores.
K-Fold Cross-Validation: Ensures model robustness and consistency.
Clustering Analysis 🔍 <a name="clustering-analysis"></a>
KMeans Clustering: Identifies key customer segments using relevant features.
DBSCAN Clustering: Finds clusters while identifying noise/outlier data points for further analysis.
Visualizations: Histograms and scatter plots illustrate the distinct customer clusters.
Project Objectives 🎯 <a name="project-objectives"></a>
Identify Key Features: Discover behavioral patterns and service usage indicative of potential churn.
Improve Retention Strategies: Use classification results and cluster analysis to propose targeted interventions.
Enhance User Experience: Optimize services and rewards based on high-transaction clients.
Data Sources 📄 <a name="data-sources"></a>
The original dataset is publicly available at Kaggle's Credit Card Churn dataset.
Visuals & Contributors 🎨 <a name="visuals-and-contributors"></a>
The project includes comprehensive visualizations in both the EDA and Analysis notebooks.
