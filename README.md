## 🚀 Getting Started

**Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/credit-card-churn-analysis.git

**Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA notebook explores customer data, examining relationships between ClientNum ranges and customer behavior. It visualizes attrition patterns, feature correlations, and provides initial hypotheses on why customers might churn.

## 📊 Model Training and Evaluation

Two classification models are trained using various oversampling techniques to handle class imbalance:
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall scores are calculated to measure model accuracy, recall, and F1-scores.

## 📊 Clustering Analysis

- **KMeans Clustering:** Identifies key customer segments using relevant features.
- **Visualizations:** Histograms and scatter plots illustrate the distinct customer clusters.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **Identify Key Features:** Analyze which features are most indicative of potential churn.
- **Improve Retention Strategies:** Use clustering results and user analysis to propose targeted interventions.
- **Enhance User Experience:** Optimize services and rewards based on high-transaction clients.

## 📄 Data Sources

The original dataset is publicly available at Kaggle's Credit Card Churn dataset.

## 🌐 Visuals & Contributors
