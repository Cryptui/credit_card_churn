## 🚀 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

**Clone the Repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/credit-card-churn-analysis.git

Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

The EDA notebook explores customer data, examining relationships between ClientNum ranges and customer behavior. It visualizes attrition patterns, feature correlations, and provides initial hypotheses on why customers might churn.

## 📊 Model Training and Evaluation <a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>

Two classification models are trained using various oversampling techniques to handle class imbalance:
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall scores are calculated to measure model accuracy, recall, and F1-scores.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Ensures model robustness and consistency.

## 📊 Clustering Analysis <a name="clustering-analysis"></a>

- **KMeans Clustering:** Identifies key customer segments using relevant features.
- **DBSCAN Clustering:** Finds clusters while identifying noise/outlier data points for further analysis.
- **Visualizations:** Histograms and scatter plots illustrate the distinct customer clusters.

## 🎯 Project Objectives <a name="project-objectives"></a>
- **Identify Key Features:** Analyze which features are most indicative of potential churn.
- **Improve Retention Strategies:** Use clustering results and user analysis to propose targeted interventions.
- **Enhance User Experience:** Optimize services and rewards based on high-transaction clients.

## 📄 Data Sources <a name="data-sources"></a>

The original dataset is publicly available at Kaggle's Credit Card Churn dataset.

## 🌐 Visuals & Contributors <a name="visuals-and-contributors"></a>
